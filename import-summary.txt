ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => openGLES_FBO\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => openGLES_FBO\src\main\assets\
* res\ => openGLES_FBO\src\main\res\
* src\ => openGLES_FBO\src\main\java\
* src\org\obj2openjl\boxes.wvo => openGLES_FBO\src\main\resources\org\obj2openjl\boxes.wvo

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
